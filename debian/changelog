timidity (2.13.2-5) unstable; urgency=high

  * The arts_free() fixes are now considered stable (although aRts
    support is still much worse than ALSA support, and it has some ugly
    open bugs), so set urgency=high on this upload
  * Fix gcc 3.4 FTBFS problem, thanks to Andreas Jochens <aj@andaco.de>
    for the patch (closes: #280267)

    <georg.wittenburg@gmx.net> for feedback on how 2.13.2-3 worked out.

timidity (2.13.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * It seems that doing some QA work and submiting a patch to the upstream
    BTS can really wake them up :)
  * upstream CVS: Fix NULL pointer derreference on empty sample names
  * Minor updates to package descriptions in the control file
  * Add primary watch file entry based on prdownloads.sf.net, since the
    ftp servers for sf.net are not realiable at all
  * Drop all aRts functionality that requires arts_free().  See Debian
    bug #247793, TiMidity++ bug #25, KDE bug #84514.  aRts users, you better
    give me some feedback about how well 2.13.2-3 works with aRts, otherwise
    I will seriously consider killing aRts support altogether for the next
    stable release (closes: #239982)

    + remove libgtk1.2-dev, since we disabled the GTK frontend because
